Collective Action for Nomadic Small-Angle Scatterers (canSAS) provides standards and tools for the small-angle scattering user community. See more at https://www.cansas.org

canSAS defines a data format used in `drtsans`. During biosans, gpsans, and eqsans workflows, a canSAS file is generated that describes the 2-dimensional workspace I(Qx, Qy) with error.
