Disk choppers allow neutrons through with only certain wavelengths. These permitted wavelengths are grouped
into one or more *wavelength bands*. This module provides objects to represent one or a set of wavelength bands.
In addition, the module contains helper functions for conversion between wavelength and time-of-flight, taking
into account the distance traveled by the neutron and its delayed emission time from the moderator.
